# ABCUcourses
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms: Analysis and Design Project

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Throughout CS300, I worked with ABC University to develop software that would help their computer science advisors access course information for students. 

## How did you approach the task? 
I first approached the task by developing pseudocode for each data structure (Hash Tables, Binary Trees, and Vectors). Compiling working code for each. I then performed an analysis of the run-time and memory, based on Big-O, to decide which data structure would work best, before finally writing my program. Data structures each have their own strengths and weaknesses that must be considered depending on the required functionality.  

## How did you overcome and any roadblocks you encountred while going through the projects or activities?
From addressing collisions in hash tables to searching through the nodes of a binary search tree, I studied an large number of examples and watched numerous videos to understand the logic. Fortunately, the documentation on each of these data structures is extensive so I had a library of coding examples to model my code after.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This class exposed me to a side of coding that I did not value or take the time to consider. I rarely thought of the underlining data structures and how these decisions could impact the longterm functionality or runtime of a program. Moving forward, I will have a more detailed, organized, and meticulous style of writing code. This is a total transformation compared to my previous style where I would immediately rush into writing lines of code, only stopping to make a decision when I reached an error.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project will help me in the future to optimize the efficiency of the code that I write, which I learned based on the run-time analysis, showed me even more value of the benefits of commenting code, and proven to me that the study of data structures is not only necessary to understand code written by others, but to assist me in the writing of my own, proficient code.
